<h1><b>Friends</b></h1>
<p>This is a picture of me with my three roommates, Jack, Cam and Luis. They're some of my closest friends and it's a blast living with them. We do pretty much everything together while we're at school. Whether that's going to the gym, going grocery shopping, going to a party, going to hockey games or playing video games. Being with my friends all the time makes the hard stuff about college a lot easier.</p>
