My name is Jacob Storey and I'm a Business Management major at the University of Maine. I grew up in Cumberland Maine, just north of Portland. I love playing lots of different sports and hanging out with my friends! I have one younger sister who attends the University of Southern Maine. I'm excited to take this class and learn more about MIS!
