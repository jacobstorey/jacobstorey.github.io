<h1><B>Hiking</B></h1>
<p>
    I love to be outdoors. I like hunting, fishing, skiing, and many other outdoor activities. In the summer, when I'm not working, I'm always outside doing something. One of my favorite outdoor hobbies is hiking. A couple of my friends and I have hiked Mt. Katahdin and Mt. Washington both numerous times. There's just something about being so high up and being able to see so far that I can't get enough of. This is a picture of me with my friends on top of Mt. Katahdin in 2017.</p>
